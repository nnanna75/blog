        <p class="make">The Brinstock Sole is one of the most expensive and most quality sole used in making most of the
            footwears
            <br><br>we see around including the popular ones. They are very soft when you put them on.
            They are not just soft but<br><br> also durable. They also last very long including during the raining
            season.
            You can also wash or clean them<br><br> with what you wish to use. You can also soak in water 24hours in
            7days and be
            assured that nothing will happen<br><br> to it, it will still be as strong as it was when you bought or made
            it. The
            Brinstock Sole can be used in making<br><br> different kinds of designs.<br><br><br><br>

            Design,<br><br>
            The Nora Sole Design and many more. They are also very much expensive just like the Brinstock
            Design.<br><br>
            Depending on the colour of the design of the Hermes Design it matches or goes well with any kind of
            dress you<br><br> wish to try it out with. The price depends on the sole used. The Nora Sole,
